Jump and Run with AI: A Reinforcement Learning Approach
Abstract
This project implements a simple "Jump and Run" game using Pygame, where an artificial intelligence (AI) agent learns to navigate obstacles through reinforcement learning. The AI is trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to maximize its score by avoiding obstacles and surviving as long as possible. The game and learning process are visualized using matplotlib for analysis and evaluation.


1. Introduction
The "Jump and Run with AI" project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques in a gaming environment. The goal is to train an AI agent to control a player character that must jump to avoid obstacles and earn rewards. The project uses the Pygame library for game development and PyTorch for implementing the DQN model.


2. Game Description
The game features:

A player character that can either jump or stay on the ground.
Obstacles that appear from the right side of the screen and move leftward.
A jumping mechanic that allows the player to avoid obstacles.
A scoring system that rewards the player for surviving and crossing obstacles.
2.1 Game Mechanics
Player Movement: The player can jump to avoid obstacles. Horizontal movement is not controlled by the player.
Obstacles: Obstacles are generated with a width and height proportional to the jump height to ensure they are manageable.
Score: The score increases with time and rewards are given for crossing obstacles and achieving high scores.


3. Reinforcement Learning Approach
The AI agent is trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) which learns to make decisions based on state-action values.

3.1 DQN Architecture
Network Structure: The Q-network consists of three fully connected layers with ReLU activations. The input consists of normalized game state features, and the output provides Q-values for the two possible actions: jump or do nothing.
Training: The model is trained using experience replay, where past experiences are stored and sampled to train the network. The loss is calculated using mean squared error between predicted and target Q-values.

3.2 Rewards and Penalties
Base Reward: A small reward is given for survival.
Obstacle Cross Reward: A reward is given when an obstacle is crossed.
High Score Reward: Additional reward for setting a new high score.
Collision Penalty: Penalty for colliding with an obstacle.
Jump Penalty: Small penalty for jumping, encouraging the agent to jump only when necessary.


4. Implementation
   
4.1 Setup
Libraries Used: Pygame for game development, PyTorch for machine learning, and matplotlib for plotting training results.
Game Parameters: The game window is 800x600 pixels, and the playerâ€™s jump height is fixed at 100 pixels.

4.2 Code Details
Normalization: Game states are normalized to ensure the model's input is consistent.
Obstacle Generation: Obstacles are generated with dimensions based on a fraction of the jump height to maintain balance.
Training Loop: The model is trained over 200,000 epochs with experience replay, and rewards are computed based on the game state and actions taken.

5. Results
The performance of the AI agent is evaluated through:

Training Progress: Metrics such as total rewards, average Q-values, and loss are plotted.
Game Performance: The agent's ability to avoid obstacles and maximize the score is analyzed.
6. Conclusion
The "Jump and Run with AI" project successfully demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning in a gaming context. The DQN model learns to navigate obstacles effectively, and the visualization tools provide insights into the training process.


6. Future Work
Future improvements could include:
Enhancing the Neural Network: Exploring more advanced architectures for better performance.
Fine-Tuning Reward Mechanisms: Adjusting rewards and penalties to improve learning efficiency.
Expanding the Game: Adding more features and complexities to increase the challenge for the AI.
